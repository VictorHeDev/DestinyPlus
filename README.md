# WELCOME TO DESTINY PLUS

[Check out the Live Site!](https://destinyplus.herokuapp.com/#/)

### Introduction
Destiny Plus is a clone of the Disney Plus website at the time of creation. Disney Plus is a streaming platform that users can sign up for to watch movies and tv shows from the comfort of their own home. I am a huge fan of their original content thus I decided to create this fullstack project to showcase some of my technical skills as well as having a lot of fun with currating my favorite content from agnostic sources. Lastly, I was inspired by their fantastic styling and great UI design. The technologies used in this project include:

- React
- Redux
- JavaScript
- HTML
- SCSS
- Ruby on Rails
- Postgres
- Heroku
- ... and many more!
